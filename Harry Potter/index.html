			<p>or years, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has been
				a heaven for any who have come seeking help. But on the night when
				He Who Must Not Be Named came calling, Hogwarts was no longer a 
				heaven. It became a battlefield, and many lives were lost in the fight
				to save the school and defeat You Know Who once and for all. Now, in
				honor of those who died in the Battle of Hogwarts, a memorial is being
				built in the fields near Albus Dumbledore's final resting</p>
